/*

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Follow up: Could you implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and without using extra memory?

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104
Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
// Time: O(n)
// Space: O(n)
var singleNumber = function(nums) {
  let set = new Set();

  for (let num of nums) {
    if (set.has(num)) {
      set.delete(num);
    } else {
      set.add(num);
    }
  }

  return Array.from(set)[0];
};

Approach 3: Math
Concept

2 * (a + b + c) - (a + a + b + b + c) = c2∗(a+b+c)−(a+a+b+b+c)=c

There's also a bitwise solution that has a space complexity of O(1)
